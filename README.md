# Metasploit-loading-screen
The loading screen of Metasploit, i.e. " |->/->\->|->/->\->| " in C++ which can be executed in Windows too...
The coding is pretty easy once you know how to print the "\" symbol...(Its actually done by "\\".)
So, File details:

main.cpp-> Source C++ file.
Loading.exe-> Directly executable file for Windows.
Loading.cbp-> Code::Blocks project file.

And thats pretty much it...
