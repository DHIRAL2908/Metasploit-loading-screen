# Metasploit-loading-screen
The loading screen of Metasploit, i.e. " |->/->\\->|->/->\\->| " in C++ which can be executed in Windows too...
The coding is pretty easy once you know how to print the "\\" symbol...(Its actually done by "\\\\".)

So, File details:


main.cpp-> Source C++ file.

Loading.exe-> Directly executable file for Windows.

Loading.cbp-> Code::Blocks project file.


I know the code could have been smaller if I just had the " |->/->\\ " in FOR loop. I just didn't think of that when I was preparing it.
And thats pretty much it...
